EduBridge: Empowering Visually and Hearing Impaired Students

Problem Statement-
Millions of visually and hearing-impaired students face difficulties in accessing mainstream educational content due to lack of inclusive formats. Traditional teaching methods fail to accommodate their needs, leading to learning gaps and reduced opportunities. There's an urgent need for an inclusive digital learning platform that makes complex educational content accessible and engaging for all learners, regardless of ability. Many visually and hearing-impaired students struggle with inaccessible learning formats, limiting their educational growth.  There's also a lack of personalized tools and parent-friendly systems to support and monitor their learning progress.

Proposed solution:
EduBridge is an AI-powered inclusive learning platform that transforms textbooks and complex concepts into:
Explainable audio for blind students.
Sign language videos for deaf students.
Summarized content using NLP for quick understanding.
3D visualizations, flowcharts, and animated videos for conceptual clarity
Parent portal with progress tracking, scanner-based login using unique ID
The system uses a seamless UI to upload documents and receive personalized learning output.
Multiple language support , helping students from different regions.
Chatbot support for the users.
